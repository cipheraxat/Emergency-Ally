	<h1 align="center">A Comprehensive Synchronization by Deriving Fluent Pipeline for Emergency Services and Healthcare using Natural Language Processing</h2>
	<h4 > 2020 has been a rough year. We started with a wildfire in Australia , saw half of our world die due to COVID, migrant workers moved across states in our country,skies in California turned orange as the state choked up the fire fumes and what not. We have faced every calamity possible in this year and we , Team Myth Busters think , it would be stupid not to prepare ourselves for the future. So, lo and behold , Emergency Ally, a smart website designed to always be there for you in the time of emergency and get you out of it as soon as possible. <h4>Built using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,Emergency Ally is a Comprehensive Web App which can help you provide SOS or Emergency Level Solutions , In Case You encounter or see someone in any Danger or Disaster Situtations.

## Functionalities
- [x]  Input Emergency
- [x]  Classification of emergency:Classifies your emergency to a bunch of other related emergency types 
- [x]  Priority Sorting:our model understands how urgent your search is and assigns it a priority level 
- [x]  Location Based Results:Gives you location based suggestions of nearest help centers and their contact information.

The goal of this project is to apply the data engineering skills learned in the course to analyze disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The project is divided in three sections:
* **Data Processing**: build an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Pipeline to extract data from the given dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database
* **Machine Learning Pipeline**: split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that predicts a message classifications for the 36 categories (multi-output classification)
* **Web development** develop a web application to show classify messages in real time

## Software and Libraries

This project uses Python 3.7.2 and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* [dash](https://plot.ly/dash/)

More informations in `requirements.txt`. To create it I have used `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt`. To install all Python packages written in the requirements.txt file run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Data

The dataset is provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/) is basically composed by:
* **disaster_categories.csv**: Categories of the messages
* **disaster_messages.csv**: Multilingual disaster response messages

## Running the code

From the project folder run `python dash_disaster_response_pipeline.py` to start the dash application. The default url to connect to it is http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

<pre>
|-- disaster_response_pipeline_project
    |-- disaster_response_pipeline
    |   |-- data
    |   |   |-- ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb
    |   |   |-- process_data.py    
    |   |   |-- disaster_categories.csv 
    |   |   |-- disaster_messages.csv     
    |   |
    |   |-- classifier
    |   |   |-- ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb
    |   |   |-- train_classifier.py
    |   |   |-- trained_classifier.pkl
    |   |
    |   |-- disaster_response_pipeline.py
    |   |-- dash_disaster_response_pipeline.py
    |
    |-- db.sqlite3
    |-- db_dump.txt
    |-- README.md
</pre>

If the application does not find the **trained_classifier.pkl** pickle file to load the model it will check also if the database **db.sqlite3** present and if not process the data and finaly train the model (save it in **classifier/trained_classifier.pkl**) to get the application ready to classify messages in real time.

Flowchart made using [draw.io](https://about.draw.io/)

All the modules provide the help funcionality provided by [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module.

By default the [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) for the best parameters for the model is disable because of the long time required to perform it. To perform it run **train_classifier.py** with the option `--grid_search_cv`

To run the the preparation [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) run the command `jupyter notebook ETL_Pipeline_Preparation.ipynb` or `jupyter notebook ML_Pipeline_Preparation.ipynb` in the folder were the file is located.    

Using sqlite3 command shell is possible to extract a dump of the database if needed:

`sqlite3 db.sqlite3`

`sqlite3> .output db_dump.txt`

`sqlite3> .dump`

`sqlite3> .quit`

## Results

When no message is give in input the application gives an overview of the dataset in the home page

![Overview of Training Dataset](images/overview_training_dataset.JPG)

When a messagge is submitted with the **Classify Message** button the resulting categories are highlighted in green

![Classification Result](images/classification_result.JPG)

As shown in the **Overview of Training Dataset** section the dataset is highly imbalanced and that is the reason why the accuracy is high and the recall value is pretty low. To tackle and imbalanced dataset there are a lot of ways as shown in this really intresting [post](https://medium.com/james-blogs/handling-imbalanced-data-in-classification-problems-7de598c1059f)

## TODO

* 0 - Delete this TODO section when all the tasks are working properly
